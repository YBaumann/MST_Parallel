# MST_Parallel

Personal project of a parallel spanning tree algorithm that uses only the openmp for directive and no other OpenMP functions.

Create graphs using the python scripts in Graph creation and run main.cpp to compute the Spanning tree in parallel.

Implemented algorithms include Boruvka and Prim
