This is not a conclusive test!
I tested The Code of Boruvka parallel vs sequential. I have not optimized anything for cachehitrate.
I ran the function 100 times and took the mean for every level of optimization.

Avg Time for Boruvka Parallel: 32 threads, 100K Vertices 6M edges
660'908 microseconds no optimization
314'733 O1 optimization
305'053 O2 optimization


Avg Time for Boruvka Seq: 100K Vertices, 6M edges
1'385'360 microseconds no optimization
395'562 O1 optimization
400'094 O2 optimization
