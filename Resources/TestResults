We tested The first working parallel Implementation and got the following times:
Par = 4.6948s
Seq = 0.291398

Next we will check what part of the parallel implementation takes the most time:
Here are the timestamps for each Boruvkastep in parallel:
Stepnr: 1 took 1.50594 sec
Stepnr: 2 took 1.10605 sec
Stepnr: 3 took 0.824964 sec
Stepnr: 4 took 0.616495 sec
Stepnr: 5 took 0.569029 sec

In Comparison Sequential:
Stepnr: 1 for Seq Implementation took 0.059304 sec
Stepnr: 2 for Seq Implementation took 0.066826 sec
Stepnr: 3 for Seq Implementation took 0.045707 sec
Stepnr: 4 for Seq Implementation took 0.044192 sec
Stepnr: 5 for Seq Implementation took 0.047723 sec

Each step has some part that takes really long. I suspect it to be the edgelist to adjarray conversion.
Here are the times for each conversion in a step
Time: 0.445923 sec
Time: 0.261265 sec
Time: 0.206302 sec
Time: 0.21638 sec
Time: 0.25962 sec

This makes up 1.37s approximately 30% of the time taken. WHat other factors take long?
